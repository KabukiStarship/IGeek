## Mission and Vision

The mission of IGEEK is to make it easier to build, test, and compare AI Agents from bare-metal to the Cloud. The vision of IGEEK is to create a portable robotics simulator that can also be used for games and scientific computing.

## Organization

IGEEK is built with [Script2](https://github.com/kabuki-starship/script2), [Kabuki Toolkit](https://github.com/kabuki-starship/kabuki.toolkit), and [Kabuki Tek Toolkit](https://github.com/kabuki-starship/kabuki.toolkit.tek). Currently this repo has no work done on it, but there has been a moderate amount of work done on igeek.human in Java that was never ported, but we're using SFML now. The projects we're going to be working on in the Astartup Live-stream are.

1. [igeek.human](https://github.com/kabuki-starship/igeek.) - An abstract simulation of the Human immune system with robotic white blood cells that fight off genetically modified viruses.
1. [igeek.bock_world](https://github.com/kabuki-starship/igeek.bock_world) - A Modern Embedded-C++ port of [STB's Voxel rendering engine](https://github.com/nothings/stb) in [Script2](https://github.com/kabuki-starship/script2).
1. [igeek.tile_world](https://github.com/kabuki-starship/igeek.tile_world) - A 2D tile game engine.
1. [igeek.rpg_toolkit](https://github.com/kabuki-starship/igeek.rpg_toolkit) - A role-playing game IGEEK extension.
1. [igeek.autopilot](https://github.com/kabuki-starship/igeek.autopilot) - An autopilot for IGEEK environments.
1. [igeek.ulator](https://github.com/kabuki-starship/igeek.ulator) - An IMUL graphing Calculator IGEEK extension.
